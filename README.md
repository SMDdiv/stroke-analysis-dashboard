# 🧠 Stroke Risk Dashboard - Streamlit App

This project is a **data visualization dashboard** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to analyze the **Healthcare Stroke Dataset**. It provides interactive graphs and insights into the factors related to stroke occurrences among patients.

## 📁 Dataset

- Demographics (age, gender, residence)
- Health indicators (hypertension, heart disease, BMI, etc.)
- Behavioral aspects (smoking status, work type)
- Stroke outcome (stroke: 0 = No, 1 = Yes)
